## Description

A web application that will allow the developer-user to collect their tweets and save them to a database of "evergreen" (not dated, always relevant) tweets. They will then be able to retweet tweets stored in said database either at regular intervals, or manually.

This Tweet-reGenerator is a Twitter-dedicated, light-weight clone of [MeetEdgar](https://meetedgar.com/), a social media management tool.

-[ ] UI provides an attractive, intuitive user experience.
-[ ] Code is readable and well organized
-[ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the MIT license.
